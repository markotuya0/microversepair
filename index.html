                      <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro,</strong> (born February 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal),
                       Portuguese football (soccer) forward who was one of the greatest players of his generation.
                      <br><br>
                      Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha.
                       (The name Ronaldo was added to Cristiano’s name in honour of his father’s favourite movie actor, Ronald Reagan, 
                       that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first played for Clube 
                       Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting Lisbon), where
                        he played for that club’s various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first team in 2002.
                      <br><br>
                      A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the pitch. Originally a right-winger,
                       he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was able to mesmerize opponents with a sleight of 
                       foot that made sufficient space for openings in opposing defenses.
                       After a successful season with Sporting that brought the young player to the attention of Europe’s biggest football clubs,
                        Ronaldo signed with English powerhouse Manchester United in 2003. He was an instant sensation and soon came to be regarded 
                        as one of the best forwards in the game. His finest season with United came in 2007–08, when he scored 42 League and Cup goals
                         and earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer, with 31 League goals. After helping United to a Champions League 
                         title in May 2008, Ronaldo captured Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Player of the Year honours 
                         for his stellar 2007–08 season. He also led United to an appearance in the 2009 Champions League final, which they lost to FC Barcelona.
